Solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). 

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Solutions
There are two ways to view the solutions:
* **Folder view** - Each solution exists in a separate folder for each day, this folder contains the question, the data input and the solution code.
* **All in one view** - You can view all the solutions inside the file `puzzle.py`, the data for each of the questions also exist in a single file called `data.py`.

### Folder view
* Three files
  * Solution file: `solution.py`
  * Data file: `input.txt`
  * Question file: `Question.md`

### All in one view
* Two python files
  * Solution file: `puzzle.py`
  * Data file: `data.py`
    * Copied and pasted data from the input file and added added speech marks and comma to get it into a list
      * `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` into VSCode. 
      * In VSCode: `Ctrl+A`, `Alt+Shift+I`, `End`, add on to end `",`, then press `Home` and append to beginning `"`.
    * Alternatively, I could have save it as a text file and loaded it in using `with open(...`, this is done in folder view instead.
